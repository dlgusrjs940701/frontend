            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
              Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
              when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

            <h3>Column 2</h3>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
              making it over 2000 years old.</p>

              content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>
